# CSC-317
For this project we wanted to build a fitness e-comerce website. We looked at similar sites and took a liking to LuluLemons format and how they displayed their products and engaged with users. 
We wanted to make this site user friendly, appealing to the eye, and engaging. In order to make this user friendly we added well sought after products, a detailed description with a star rating. With our navbar it is very easy to navigatr thoughout the website. 
One of our key focus was to make the site responsive on all type of screen displays. That took a lot of coding but we managed to make it look appealing to the eye.

Technologies Used: HTML5 for structuring the site. CSS for syling the site and making it responsive. JavaScript for interactive features. SQL, express.js, EJS, node.JS, and databases for the backend side for managing user data.
Some key features of our site is our resoponive home page that is very welcoming, a detailed product page, and user autheication.
